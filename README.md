# what-i-learned-week-8

# A whole lot of Methods.

* We basically focused on methods and writing them as functions to get a better understanding of how they work.
* This was by far the most challenging week.
* Methods we learned were :
  * _.split_ - which splts a string into an array.
  * _.slice_ - which slices a string according to what index you have specified.
  * _.join_ - which joins strings after you split them.
